# Overcoming Life's Hurdles: Turning Failure into Success
Have you ever felt like you're putting all this work and effort, but unable to make progress? Feeling lost and hopeless without a sense of direction? We have all been there, whether it's a career setback, a personal failure, relationships, these moments are incredibly challenging. How we choose to react to these obstacles will determine if we succeed or fail. Obstacles give you a sense of direction, an oppurtunity to make progress and self-improve to become a better person. 

## Why do we get this feeling of being stuck
We often compare ourselves to others. This maybe through physical attraction, material wealth, or careers. We are never satisfied with ourselves, we always want more. We create our own problems and find clever ways to keep us down this endless pit of self-rejection. We fear failure, we don't want to take risks so we trap ourselves and our abilities. We want to stay in our comfort zone, discomfort is painful so why seek it. 

## Finding the way forward
Accept the pain, accept failure. You must know that failure does not define you. Know that the pain of failure is the greatest indicator for success, as it shows that you will perserve and forge your own path through unknown territory.

Always keep moving forward, do one small habit each day. Become self-aware and be less harsh on yourself for failing.
